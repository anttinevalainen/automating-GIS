# Week 5

Practicing how to create static and interactive maps using Python. The goal is to allow focus on cartographic visualization with Python, and to play around and explore different possibilities of the available visualization packages.

In this exercise, all instructions are given in this readme and one should create all necessary files for completing the exercise. At the end, there should be a notebook-file or a python script file in the root folder, and the output maps for problems 1 and 2 in `.png` and `.html` format uder the `docs` folder. Finally, you will publish the maps online (problem 3).


## Problem 1: Visualize a static map

Create a static map. The map should contain multiple layers of data (at least two different data sets), and you should pay attention to the classification and visualization (colors, edges etc.) when creating the map. Write your code into a `.ipynb` -file or a `.py` -file and store the output maps under the `docs` folder.

**Topic of the map:**
- Either use the datasets we have already used during this course, or you select some other data set of your interest.

**Criteria:**
- The map should have multiple layers on it and portay some kind of classification and/or an analysis output
- The map should demonstrate skills learned throughout this course.

**Output:**
- Remember to commit the code and input data (or at least a link to input data)
- Save your maps in the `docs` -folder


## Problem 2: Visualize an interactive map

Create a nice interactive map using either Folium or mplleaflet. Write your code into a `.ipynb` -file or a `.py` -file and store the output maps in `.html` format under the `docs` folder.

**Topic of the map:**
- You can select the topic of the map freely.
- This map should not be only an interactive version of your submission for problem 1.

**Criteria:**
- The map should have multiple layers on it and present an output of simple data analysis
- The map should demonstrate skills learned throughout this course.
- Think about including additional interactive elements, such as popup text in the map.

**Output:**
- Remember to commit the code and input data
- Save your maps in `.html` format in the `docs` folder


## Problem 3: Publish your maps online (2 points)

 You should now have **ALL** your maps stored in the `docs` folder inside this repository

- Add links to those maps in the `.md` -file in the `docs` folder.
- Provide a short description of each map in the `.md` -file
- Publish your maps with github pages
